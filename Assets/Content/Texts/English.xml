	<spw_customsoundstooltip>Tweak the volume of any vanilla or modded sounds. Providing a sidechain multiplier above zero will mark the sound(s) for sidechaining, lowering the volume of other sounds by the amount specified (a value of 1 is equal to a 100% volume reduction). The release value controls how many seconds it takes for the sidechain multiplier to decay to back to zero after the sound plays. Sounds in the exclusion list are ignored, allowing for more selective group targeting.</spw_customsoundstooltip>

	<!-- 2.0 Popup message -->
	<spw_popupheader>Welcome to Soundproof Walls 2.0</spw_popupheader>
	<spw_popupheadersubtext>Soundproof Walls 2.0 is a fully rewritten and expanded version of the original mod and stands as a complete audio system overhaul for Barotrauma.</spw_popupheadersubtext>

	<spw_popupbodyheader>Major Changes (NOTE: ALL THIS TEXT IS A WIP DRAFT)</spw_popupbodyheader>
	
	<spw_popupbodysubheading1>• Environmentally Simulated Reverb</spw_popupbodysubheading1>
	<spw_popupbodysubtext1>Sounds and player voices echo realistically in large or quiet spaces depending on the size and soundscape of the room. Outside the submarine, loud sounds can be heard echoing for miles as the soundwaves bounce off the icy surface of Europa.</spw_popupbodysubtext1>

	<spw_popupbodysubheading2>• Sidechain Compression System</spw_popupbodysubheading2>
	<spw_popupbodysubtext2>Loud sounds, like gunshots or explosions, feel more powerful as they crush other audio in the mix by dipping their volume.</spw_popupbodysubtext2>

	<spw_popupbodysubheading3>• Dynamic Lowpass Frequency</spw_popupbodysubheading3>
	<spw_popupbodysubtext3>Sounds are no longer limited to being muffled at one set strength and will now dynamically adapt based on how many layers of obstructions are in the way.</spw_popupbodysubtext3>

	<spw_popupbodysubheading4>• Sound Occlusion</spw_popupbodysubheading4>
	<spw_popupbodysubtext4>Sounds are muffled by the shape of the surrounding level geometry as they explore their path to the player's ears.</spw_popupbodysubtext4>

	<spw_popupbodysubheading5>• Powerful Distortion</spw_popupbodysubheading5>
	<spw_popupbodysubtext5>Gunshots, explosions, and other loud sounds distort violently. By default this effect is somewhat subtle, but I wouldn't recommend increasing the edge or gain too high; if you don't believe me, just remember I'm the guy who made Real Sonar.</spw_popupbodysubtext5>

	<spw_popupbodysubheading6>• Vanilla Improvements</spw_popupbodysubheading6>
	<spw_popupbodysubtext6>Water flow and fire sounds are finally muffled by walls and other obstructions. Additionally the maximum concurrent sound count has been increased to prevent many sounds being skipped (e.g., when firing a fully automatic gun).</spw_popupbodysubtext6>

	<spw_popupbodysubheading7>• Sound Propagation</spw_popupbodysubheading7>
	<spw_popupbodysubtext7>Certain sounds are better at piercing through nearby walls and doors, allowing them to be heard clearer on the other side. By default this applies to structural damage sounds, explosions, and turrets.</spw_popupbodysubtext7>

	<spw_popupbodysubheading8>• 100+ New Config Settings</spw_popupbodysubheading8>
	<spw_popupbodysubtext8>Soundproof Walls has never been so customizable. 2.0 grants complete control over the properties and effects for every individual sound. The default settings are designed to be the most applicable to the general playerbase, but there is enormous potential for vastly different configuations and the ability to make whatever soundscape you desire. It's also possible to revert back to the Soundproof Walls 1.0 feel by switching to the classic effect processing mode</spw_popupbodysubtext8>
