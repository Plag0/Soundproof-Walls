	<spw_customsoundstooltip>Apply custom values and effects to specific sounds.\n\n"Keyword": Part of the target sound's file name. Case insensitive.\n\n"GainMult": Volume multiplier. Stacks additively with other volume multipliers.\n\n"RangeMult": Range multiplier. Stacks multiplicatively with other range multipliers.\n\n"SidechainMult": The volume that other sounds are reduced by when this sound plays.\n\n"SidechainRelease": The duration that the volume reduction lasts for.\n\n"Distortion": Toggles the distortion effect for this sound. Dynamic mode only.\n\n"PitchMult": Pitch multiplier. Works by stretching the sound's length. Ranges between 0.25-4.0.\n\n"MuffleInfluence": Effectiveness of muffle effects. Lower values mean less affected.\n\n"KeywordExclusions": Sounds that contain the provided Keyword but are ignored. For example, the Keyword "shot" registers sounds called "gunshot" but can also register sounds you wouldn't want gunshot values applied to, like "tasershot". To avoid this overlap without using a more specific Keyword, you would place "tasershot" in this list. Case insensitive.</spw_customsoundstooltip>

	<!-- 2.0 Popup message -->
	<spw_popupheader>Welcome to Soundproof Walls 2.0</spw_popupheader>
	<spw_popupheadersubtext>Soundproof Walls 2.0 is a fully rewritten and expanded version of the original mod and stands as a complete audio system overhaul for Barotrauma.</spw_popupheadersubtext>

	<spw_popupbodyheader>Major Changes</spw_popupbodyheader>
	
	<spw_popupbodysubheading1>• Environmentally Simulated Reverb</spw_popupbodysubheading1>
	<spw_popupbodysubtext1>Sounds and player voices echo realistically based on the size and volume of the room. Outside the submarine, loud sounds can be heard echoing for miles as the soundwaves bounce off the icy surface of Europa.</spw_popupbodysubtext1>

	<spw_popupbodysubheading2>• Sidechain Compression System</spw_popupbodysubheading2>
	<spw_popupbodysubtext2>Sounds like gunshots or explosions are louder and more impactful. This new dynamic range creates a feeling of power behind every shot as quieter sounds are left behind.</spw_popupbodysubtext2>

	<spw_popupbodysubheading3>• Dynamic Lowpass Frequency</spw_popupbodysubheading3>
	<spw_popupbodysubtext3>Sounds are no longer limited to being muffled at one set strength and will now dynamically adapt based on the situation and how many obstructions are in the way.</spw_popupbodysubtext3>

	<spw_popupbodysubheading4>• Sound Occlusion</spw_popupbodysubheading4>
	<spw_popupbodysubtext4>Sounds are muffled by the shape of the surrounding level geometry as they explore their path to the player's ears.</spw_popupbodysubtext4>

	<spw_popupbodysubheading5>• Powerful Distortion</spw_popupbodysubheading5>
	<spw_popupbodysubtext5>Gunshots, explosions, and other loud sounds distort violently. By default this effect is subtle, but I wouldn't recommend increasing the distortion gain too high.</spw_popupbodysubtext5>

	<spw_popupbodysubheading6>• Better Voice Chat</spw_popupbodysubheading6>
	<spw_popupbodysubtext6>Choose how clear your radio sounds with the custom radio filter or try out the new local voice system that dynamically adjusts how far your voice travels based on how loud you're yelling.</spw_popupbodysubtext6>
	
	<spw_popupbodysubheading7>• Overhauled Systems</spw_popupbodysubheading7>
	<spw_popupbodysubtext7>The eavesdropping and hydrophone systems from 1.0 have received a full makeover with new visuals and sound effects. Vanilla systems have also been improved, with water flow sounds finally being muffled by walls and a key fix for sounds occasionally not playing.</spw_popupbodysubtext7>

	<spw_popupbodysubheading8>• Absolute Control</spw_popupbodysubheading8>
	<spw_popupbodysubtext8>With 150+ new config options and a brand new settings menu, you have complete control over the properties and effects of every individual sound, allowing for many unique configurations</spw_popupbodysubtext8>
