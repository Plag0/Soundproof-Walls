	<spw_generalsettings>General Settings</spw_generalsettings>
	<spw_syncsettingsalert>Note: This server has syncing enabled - all players will automatically use the host's settings (values in parentheses)</spw_syncsettingsalert>
	
	<spw_enabled>Enabled</spw_enabled>
	<spw_enabledtooltip>Toggles all functionality of the mod</spw_enabledtooltip>
	<spw_effectprocessingmode>Effect Processing</spw_effectprocessingmode>
	<spw_effectprocessingmodetooltip>Determines what audio effects are used and how are they processed. This is the core setting for Soundproof Walls and it has three available "modes" (you can learn more about each mode by dragging the bar). While each mode delivers a fairly unique experience with its own pros and cons, they can be generally be thought of in terms of increasing fidelity, similar to a graphical preset in both performance cost and features (e.g., "low", "medium", and "high"). However, the performance cost for all three modes should be negligible for most systems.\nNote: updating this value while playing may briefly freeze the game as buffers are loaded</spw_effectprocessingmodetooltip>
	
	<spw_vanillafx>Classic</spw_vanillafx>
	<spw_vanillafxtooltip>This is classic Soundproof Walls. Modifies the muffle buffer provided by the vanilla game.\nPros:\n• Zero performance considerations\n\nCons:\n• Only one muffle frequency (creates a very on/off feel)\n• No reverb support</spw_vanillafxtooltip>
	<spw_staticfx>Static</spw_staticfx>
	<spw_staticfxtooltip>Adds two new muffle presets (light and medium) and optional reverb for certain sounds by creating additional buffers.\nPros:\n• Three total muffle frequencies allow for more nuanced audio\n• Reverb support for non-looping sounds\n\nCons:\n• Longer loading times (~2s) and more memory usage (~250MB)\n•Potential for instability with other sound-based Lua/C# mods (extremely unlikely)</spw_staticfxtooltip>
	<spw_dynamicfx>Dynamic</spw_dynamicfx>
	<spw_dynamicfxtooltip>Highly recommended. Uses the OpenAL Effects Extension to simulate advanced audio effects in real-time.\nPros:\n• Effectively unlimited muffle frequencies for more variety\n• Muffle strength is determined by advanced factors such as the number of surfaces the sound travelled through\n• Significantly less audio pops and crackles\n• Sounds are heard from the direction they came from instead of just their origin point, and can appear to come from multiple directions based on the environment.\n\nCons:\n• Higher CPU load which may impact performance</spw_dynamicfxtooltip>
