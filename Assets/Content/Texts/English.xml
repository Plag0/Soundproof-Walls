	<spw_openmenuhelp>Opens the Soundproof Walls settings menu.</spw_openmenuhelp>

	<spw_enabledtooltip>Toggles all functionality of the mod</spw_enabledtooltip>
	<spw_effectprocessingmode>Effect Processing</spw_effectprocessingmode>
	<spw_effectprocessingmodetooltip>How Soundproof Walls processes audio effects. Each mode has unique pros and cons which can dramatically change the experience (adjusting this setting while playing will briefly freeze the game as buffers are loaded/unloaded)</spw_effectprocessingmodetooltip>
	<spw_vanillafx>Classic</spw_vanillafx>
	<spw_vanillafxtooltip>This is classic Soundproof Walls. Modifies the muffle buffer provided by the vanilla game.\nPros:\n• Zero performance considerations\n\nCons:\n• Only one muffle frequency (creates a very on/off feel)\n• No reverb support</spw_vanillafxtooltip>
	<spw_staticfx>Static</spw_staticfx>
	<spw_staticfxtooltip>Adds two new muffle presets (light and medium) and reverb for certain sounds by creating additional buffers.\nPros:\n• Three total muffle frequencies allow for more nuanced audio\n• Reverb support for non-looping sounds\n\nCons:\n• Longer loading times (~2s) and more memory usage (~250MB)\n•Potential for instability with other sound-based Lua/C# mods (extremely unlikely)</spw_staticfxtooltip>
	<spw_dynamicfx>Dynamic</spw_dynamicfx>
	<spw_dynamicfxtooltip>Highly recommended. Uses the OpenAL Effects Extension to simulate advanced audio effects in real-time.\nPros:\n• Effectively unlimited muffle frequencies for more variety\n• Muffle strength is determined by advanced factors such as the number of surfaces the sound travelled through\n• Significantly less audio pops and crackles\n• Sounds are heard from the direction they came from instead of just their origin point, and can appear to come from multiple directions based on the environment.\n\nCons:\n• Higher CPU load which may impact performance</spw_dynamicfxtooltip>
	<spw_syncsettings>Sync Settings</spw_syncsettings>
	<spw_syncsettingstooltip>Requires server-side Lua to be running.\nSynchronizes the host/admin's local config file with all players connected to the server (this is achieved by creating a separate config held server-side for players' to inherit.
